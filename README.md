# What does this Web Scrapper do?
This Web Scrapper designed in Python is optimized to extract, transform and load articles and news from different newspapers, the data is extracted from all over the website of the targeted newspaper and the news are from the date the program was executed, then it generates a CSV file with the extraction date and this data is cleaned and processed so it can be finally loaded to a data base to further analysis.

The program is optimized so it executes 3 files in order, these files are for the extract, transform and load process, all the instructions are defined inside the pipeline.py file

Any suggestion or commentary is welcomed! ðŸ˜‰
